# tkrn's archive control tool

In summary this is a bash command line tool to help assist posting workflows to Browstertrix Cloud instances through their API. This tool allows you to have multiple json files that you based off the site you're looking to crawl giving you a 'template' of exclusions, tags and other parameters for your crawling needs. Additionally, you can bulk add sites by specifying a text file which is line delimited.Â

## tkrnctl.env

There are variables that need to be defined before using the script. BTRIX_USER and BTRIX_PASS are the credentials you use to log into Browsertrix Cloud. Additionally, you need the internal ID for the organization to submit the workflows to. That ID can be found here:

![Browsertrix Cloud Organization ID](https://github.com/tkrn/tkrnctl/blob/main/.github/tkrnctl-org-id.png?raw=true)

First copy the example for your modification:

```bash
cp tkrnctl.env.example tkrnctl.env
```

Then the following needs to be specified in tkrnctl.env:

```bash
BTRIX_USER=""  
BTRIX_PASS=""  
BTRIX_ORG=""
```

Lastly, specificy where you're warcs/wacz are located. The script will loop through the prefix of crawls to determine a list of crawled workflows/jobs.
```
WARCS_PATH=/dpool/arc/pywb/webarchive/collections/stacks/archive/
```

### Notice
This script was designed for internal use and use cases. It may not fit what you need to do but I'm always open to suggestions. This helps fill a gap in tool set for how I crawl for tkrn's archive.
